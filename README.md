# Todo List App

Run Project with  following command

npm run dev




This is a simple Todo List application built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), where users can add, edit, and manage their tasks.

## How to Set Up the Project

Follow the steps below to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes bundled with Node.js)

### Steps to Open the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swapniljukariya/Taskmanager.git
Navigate into the project folder: Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Taskmanager
Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server: To open the project in your browser, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the application and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

The npm run dev command is commonly used to start the development server in projects that use bundlers like Webpack or tools like Vite, and it will serve your application in development mode.
If you are using a different tool or setup (e.g., Create React App), you might need to use npm start instead.

Project Structure
The project contains the following structure:

bash
Copy code
/public        # Public assets like HTML file and images
/src           # Source code of the application (React components, styles, etc.)
  /components  # Reusable components
  /pages       # Page components
  App.js       # Main React component
  index.js     # Entry point of the application

### Key Update:
- I've added a specific mention of the `npm run dev` command to indicate that it's used to start the development server in this project, clarifying its role compared to `npm start`.

This should make it clearer for others on how to run the project in development mode.
