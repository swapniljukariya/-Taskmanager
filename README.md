# Vite + React Project

This project is a React application powered by Vite. Vite is a fast and efficient build tool for modern web development, and it works perfectly with React to enable a smooth development experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub username and repo name.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
cd your-repo-name
npm install
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, start the Vite development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, and you should see output in your terminal like:

```
  VITE v2.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  VITE Dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:3000/
  > Network: http://<your-ip>:3000/
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see your project running.

### 4. Build for Production

If you want to build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist/` folder with the optimized production build of your project.

### 5. Preview the Production Build

You can preview the production build locally by running:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Or, if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn preview
```

This will start a server that serves the production build of your app.
